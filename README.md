Face detection is a type of computer vision technology that is able to identify peopleâ€™s faces within digital images.The smallest element of an image is called a pixel, or a picture element. It is basically a dot in the picture. An image contains multiple pixels arranged in rows and columns.But a computer does not understand pixels as dots of color. It only understands numbers. To convert colors to numbers, the computer uses various color models.In color images, pixels are often represented in the RGB color model.
